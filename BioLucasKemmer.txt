'm Lucas Kemmer, a Computer Science student at Drexel University with a interest in game and app development, as well as computer hardware. After building my first computer, I was captivated by technology, solidifying my decision to pursue a computer science degree. Beyond the classroom, I enjoy hands-on-projects, from soldering circuits to programming microcontrollers. In the future, I hope to immerse myself in the fast-paced nature of the tech world, leveraging my ever evolving problem solving skills and knowledge to make a difference on the field.
